<h1>Mach 1 2009 course feedback</h1>
<br />
<strong>9th September – 2nd October 2009, at the Paddington House Hotel, Warrington, Cheshire.</strong><br />
<br />
I'm very proud of being a member of the support group and also of what I've achieved on the course.  I found the course very inspiring. <strong><em>Emma 
</em></strong><br />
<br />

I thought that mach1 was really useful in getting us to focus on the positives, also in allowing us to enter a chosen mindset in which to speak and just how much how we think affects how we speak.  Joan W
<br />
<br />

The biggest comment about the course that I have is that it's not only made me view my stammer in a different way but my entire life. Laura 
<br />
<br />
 
The course meant a lot to me and will carry on using the techniques we have all learned. I feel honoured to have met such a wonderful, funny, and interesting group of people. I hope we will remain friends for years to come.
I would be more than happy for you to use the photos, as they are a reflection of the great times we shared on the course. <br />

&quot;Attending the MACH 1 course has improved my confidence and positivity no end. During the four days we learnt many skills and techniques to focus our thoughts and energies into better communication and therefore speech. Putting the skills into practice has been easy and showed improvements right from day one. We all had alot of fun and made some great friends.&quot;

The Master Change course has now given me a better understanding and has helped my speech tremendously. I just need to keep up the training!

I thought the MACH 1 course was absolutely amazing.  It has given me a real insight into the psychological aspect of my speech and how I am able to change the way I think about it.  I feel like a completely different person since I have completed the MACH 1 course, so much more confident, calm and in control. It’s magic!!  Karen
<br />
<br />
I found most off the mach course useful, I think the course was very well set up and organised. Some of the exercises I found a bit hard but overall it was good. I also met alot of nice people. Mat
<br />
<br />
I am really proud that I was able to get funding for this life changing course which has been of great benefit to me and all the members of the support group.
