<h1>About us</h1>
<div align="center"><a href="#" title="Warrington Group"><img src="images/Warrington_group_1.jpg" alt="Warrington Stammerers Group" border="0" align="center" /></a></div>
<p>The Warrington support group was set up by Yinka Dolan, July 2007, for people who stammer.  
  The support group is based at the Halliwell Jones Stadium which is home to the Warrington Wolves Rugby Football team.  
  The stadium is also home to the NHS and the Speech Therapy department, the support group is supported by Speech &amp; Language Therapist Anne-Marie Jacob. <br />
  <br />
  The support group can support each other in a safe and secure environment and more importantly help you to help yourself. 
  Members discuss issues and concerns around stammering.  
  This is a time where members can practise speaking any techniques they wish to use in a speaking circle environment.
  <br />
  <br />
  Yinka Dolan has stammered since childhood but has greatly reduced her own fears of stammering, through research on the internet, various training courses, and via self help books, as a consequence, Yinka has reached a good deal of fluency.  
  Yinka believes whole heartedly, that reducing fears associated with stammering and making changes to how you look at stammering from your beliefs, intentions, and your perceptions is the key to improved fluency.  </p>
 <strong>Testimonials</strong> 
<blockquote>
As I have grown older, my speech has improved with my self confidence, but sometimes we all need a little support. 
Joining the Warrington Stammering Support Group has introduced me to others who stammer and so reduced the feeling of isolation and being the 'only one with a speech problem'. 
Fellow members provide a friendly, pressure free environment to air views and let out frustrations; offering friendly advice, based on their own life experiences. I have made some great new friends, and look forward to each monthly get together.
