<br />
The David Maguire programme work with people who stammer, not simply with their speech behaviours. 
Their approach is not just about learning physical techniques that deal effectively in the short term with dysfluencies. 
They identifies and teach the mechanics and dynamics of speaking. 
The result, in most cases, is an immediate, improved control of speech. 
To ensure continuing control in the long term, these physical techniques are supplemented by an understanding of the psychology of stammering and the benefits of self-acceptance. 
Together, these strategies combine to sustain consistent improvement.
<br />
<br />
Through techniques of concentration, assertiveness and non-avoidance, the McGuire Programme helps tackle the many fears of speaking experienced by people who stammer. 
As part of our long-term strategy, they explain the process of relapse and how to deal with it, should it occur, and we demonstrate how to challenge and begin to change lifelong negative traits. 
A sports mentality is basic to the Maguire Programme. 
Their positive attitude is for people to think of themelves as &quot;athletes&quot; training to become accomplished at a sport &ndash; the sport of speaking.

The MACH 1 programme takes you through a process that deals with who you are, your patterns of thinking and the belief structures that support stammering behaviour. The programme will help you make important changes to the way you think and behave - changes that will continue to have positive effects long after the course is ended.<br />
You will learn more about yourself, find out how to detach from negative experiences in the past and discover how to create outcomes that help you to move towards the things that are really important to you.<br />
  You will create and maintain positive and resourceful feelings and states of mind that are not dependent on external experiences.

Stammering is one of the most common speech disorders, but recent research shows that many teachers don't know how to deal with it – something the Michael Palin centre aims to change.

<a name="nlp"></a><strong>Neuro Lingustic Programming (NLP) – Mind over matter</strong> 
<br />
<br />
&quot;A field of study that attempts to build a set of transferable skills by programming the unconscious mind&quot;<br />
&quot;NLP is a collection of models, tools and techniques that enables its practitioners to: 
<ul>
<li>Communicate more effectively<br />
</li>
<li>Achieve excellence in their chosen field<br /></li>
<li>Overcome performance-limiting behaviours<br /></li>
<li> Programme their unconscious mind<br /></li>
<li>Programme themselves to improve performance and results&quot;<br /></li>
</ul>
&quot;NLP is a therapeutic technique to detect and reprogramme unconscious patterns of thought and behaviour in order to alter psychological responses. The basic principle of NLP is that it is in an individual`s power to change their own subconscious programming for the better&quot; Click <a href="http://www.anlp.org/index.asp?home=true&amp;PageID=423" title="NLP"><strong>here</strong></a> for more information</a>

  Neuro-Semantics is actualizing your highest and best. It is making real your highest meanings and visions, and it is implementing your best values and ethics.<br />
  Neuro-Semantics is a field wherein we model the essential structure of experiences using positive psychology models that focus on accessing the best resources and the highest meanings.<br />
  As such, Neuro-Semantics is about performance—performing your highest meanings so that what you know you can do. It is about meanings—adding the most robust meanings to your life to make things more meaningful and significant.<br />
  Neuro-Semantics is Winning the Inner Game to Achieve Peak Performance in the Outer Game<br />
  Your inner games are your semantics. Your inner game is your inner matrix of meaning frames. Your layers upon layers of meanings make up your inner world. Your outer games is your neurology. Here you actualize your inner meanings. First, you make meaning, then you perform that meaning via your actions. Click <a href="http://www.neurosemantics.com/">here</a> for information.
